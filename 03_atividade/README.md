## Part 1: Understanding the Data
Let's do some data exploration with the data from the freshman students of the CS Major at UFCG
This is going to be the base for our next projects.
### Solution

## Part 2: Predicting Evasion
In this lab we try to predict if a student after taking the first semester, if he/she will
return to the second semester.
### Solution

## Part 3: Kaggle Competition
Using our previous model and a couple of new approaches we're now competing for the best
predictive model on [Kaggle](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/previsao-de-evasao-em-computacao).
### Solution
The solution for this problem can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/caynan/ad2-lab3-kaggle)
also all the code is inside the `kaggle` folder.


__note__: that the code for our the charts is set to not echo, if you want to see how
they were made, check the `.Rmd` file.
